CBGP - A Codeblocks Git Plugin
==============================

About
-----
CBGP is a Git plugin for Codeblocks IDE (CodeBlocks Git Plugin, how clever!).

Note!
At the moment this plugin is on a pause while i wait for libgit2 library to become a bit more feature-complete and mature. So, don't expect sudden bursts of new code for some time :)
